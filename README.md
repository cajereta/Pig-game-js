#Pig Game!

This is another project from the Javascript course of Jonas. This one is also from the "Dom manipulation section" :)

The goal of the game is to get to 50 points.
Rolling a 1 ends your turn and makes you lose your current score so make sure to hold it if it gets high:D


NOTE: Not optimized for mobile... like... at all. XD
